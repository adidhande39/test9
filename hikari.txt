best hikari configs for a high load spring boot app
There are a few things you can consider when configuring Hikari for a high-load Spring Boot application:

Use a sufficiently large connection pool size to ensure that you have enough connections available to handle incoming requests.

Enable connection testing to ensure that the connections in your pool are still valid and can be used. This can help prevent connection leaks and improve performance.

Consider using connection pool sizing strategies such as PoolResizing. This can help ensure that your connection pool size is adjusted dynamically based on demand.

Use a fast connection test query to minimize the overhead of testing connections.

Enable metrics collection so that you can monitor the performance of your connection pool and fine-tune its configuration as needed.

Consider using a connection pool optimization library such as OptaPlanner to help fine-tune your connection pool configuration.

Make sure to properly configure the maximum lifetime and idle timeout settings for your connections to ensure that idle connections are closed and recycled as needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

can u provide code snippets for each of the points
Sure, here are code snippets for each of the points I mentioned:

Use a sufficiently large connection pool size:
Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=<size>
Enable connection testing:
Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-test-query=<query>
Use a connection pool sizing strategy such as PoolResizing:
Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.pool-resizing-enabled=true
Use a fast connection test query:
Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-test-query=<query>
Enable metrics collection:
Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.metrics-enabled=true
Use a connection pool optimization library such as OptaPlanner:
Copy code
# Add the OptaPlanner dependency to your project
implementation 'org.optaplanner:optaplanner-core:<version>'

# Enable OptaPlanner in your application.yml or application.properties file
spring.datasource.hikari.optapplanner-enabled=true
Configure the maximum lifetime and idle timeout settings for your connections:
Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.max-lifetime=<milliseconds>
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=<milliseconds>
I hope these code snippets are helpful! Let me know if you have any questions.

can u also write a class for db configuration
Sure, here is an example class that you could use to configure a Hikari data source for a Spring Boot application:

Copy code
import com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;
import org.springframework.boot.context.properties.ConfigurationProperties;
import org.springframework.boot.jdbc.DataSourceBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class DbConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties("spring.datasource.hikari")
    public HikariDataSource dataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().type(HikariDataSource.class).build();
    }
}
This class uses the @ConfigurationProperties annotation to bind the properties in the application.yml file to the HikariDataSource bean. You can then use this bean in your application to get a connection to the database.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

what is the ideal db pool size for high load
The ideal database connection pool size for a high-load application will depend on a variety of factors, including the number of incoming requests, the nature of the queries being executed, the hardware and infrastructure of the application server, and the configuration of the database server.

In general, it is recommended to start with a relatively large pool size and then fine-tune it based on performance metrics such as the rate of connection requests, connection usage patterns, and response times. You may also want to consider using a connection pool sizing strategy such as PoolResizing to help dynamically adjust the pool size based on demand.

It can be helpful to monitor the performance of your connection pool using metrics such as the number of active connections, the rate of connection requests, and the rate of connection timeouts. These metrics can help you identify any bottlenecks or performance issues and adjust the pool size accordingly.

It is also important to ensure that you have enough connections available to handle the maximum expected number of incoming requests, while also leaving enough room for connections to be closed and recycled as needed.

can we cache prepared statements in hikari
Yes, Hikari allows you to cache prepared statements to improve performance. To enable prepared statement caching, you can set the cachePrepStmts property to true and the prepStmtCacheSize property to the desired cache size.

Here is an example of how you can enable prepared statement caching in a Spring Boot application:

Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.cachePrepStmts=true
spring.datasource.hikari.prepStmtCacheSize=<size>
You can also specify the prepStmtCacheSqlLimit property to specify the maximum length of the SQL statements that will be cached.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

how is this caching helpful
Caching prepared statements can be helpful in improving the performance of a database-driven application by reducing the overhead of preparing and parsing SQL statements.

When a prepared statement is executed, the database server must first parse the SQL statement to determine its structure and validate it against the database schema. This process can be time-consuming, especially for complex or large queries.

By caching prepared statements, the database server can reuse the parsed and validated version of the SQL statement, which can significantly reduce the time required to execute the statement. This can be particularly beneficial for applications that execute the same or similar queries repeatedly, as the overhead of preparing and parsing the statements will only need to be incurred once.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

what are the configs for hikari that can optimize the db calls
Here are a few configurations that you can use to optimize database calls using Hikari:

Use a sufficiently large connection pool size to ensure that you have enough connections available to handle incoming requests.

Enable connection testing to ensure that the connections in your pool are still valid and can be used. This can help prevent connection leaks and improve performance.

Consider using a connection pool sizing strategy such as PoolResizing to help ensure that your connection pool size is adjusted dynamically based on demand.

Use a fast connection test query to minimize the overhead of testing connections.

Enable prepared statement caching to reduce the overhead of preparing and parsing SQL statements.

Enable metrics collection so that you can monitor the performance of your connection pool and fine-tune its configuration as needed.

Consider using a connection pool optimization library such as OptaPlanner to help fine-tune your connection pool configuration.

Make sure to properly configure the maximum lifetime and idle timeout settings for your connections to ensure that idle connections are closed and recycled as needed.

can u give an example for 6th point
Sure, here is an example of how you can enable metrics collection in a Spring Boot application using Hikari:

Copy code
spring.datasource.hikari.metrics-enabled=true
This will enable the collection of metrics for the connection pool, such as the number of active connections, the rate of connection requests, and the rate of connection timeouts.

You can then use these metrics to monitor the performance of your connection pool and fine-tune its configuration as needed. For example, if you are seeing a high rate of connection timeouts, you may want to increase the size of your connection pool to ensure that there are enough connections available to handle incoming requests.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
